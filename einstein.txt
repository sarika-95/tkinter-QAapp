Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein's work revolutionized our understanding of the basic laws of the universe.

The theory of relativity, published by Einstein in 1915, describes the relationship between space and time. It has two main components: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, while general relativity is concerned with gravity's effect on space and time.

Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2, expresses the equivalence of energy (E) and mass (m) with "c" being the speed of light. This equation is a fundamental concept in modern physics.

In addition to his scientific achievements, Einstein was known for his advocacy of civil rights, pacifism, and academic freedom. He became a symbol of scientific genius and a key figure in 20th-century physics.
